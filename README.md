# 🧠 Trackflo

**Trackflo** is a modern, developer-focused project and team management app inspired by tools like Linear, Notion, and Trello — built to showcase my front-end skills with clean UI, modular architecture, and scalable design.

🚀 **Live Demo:** [trackflo.netlify.app](https://trackflo.netlify.app)

⚠️ **Note:** Trackflo is currently a **frontend-only** application.  
I'm actively working on integrating **backend functionalities** such as authentication, project/task state, database integration, and more.
